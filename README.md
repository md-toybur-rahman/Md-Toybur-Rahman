### About Me

I am a dedicated Front End Developer with over 18 months of professional experience and more than 5 years working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In addition to front-end development, I have experience with back-end technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

My skills in communication, collaboration, and technical documentation further enhance my ability to deliver high-quality projects.
