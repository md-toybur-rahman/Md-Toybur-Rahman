### About Me

I am a passionate Front End Developer with over 18 months of professional experience and more than 3 years of hands-on experience in front-end development. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have successfully built and customized websites ensuring they are bug-free and highly responsive. My expertise extends to using modern tools and frameworks like React, Tailwind CSS, and Bootstrap.

In addition to front-end development, I have a good grasp of back-end technologies, including Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. I am committed to time management and target-oriented work, making me an efficient and reliable developer. My skills in communication, collaboration, and technical documentation further enhance my ability to deliver high-quality projects.
